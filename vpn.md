<strong>Here is what you need to know about a VPN:</strong> It secures your internet connection to guarantee that all of the data you're sending and receiving is encrypted and secured from prying eyes on the LOCAL NETWORK. While this service doesn't have any bandwidth or download restrictions, it is not for illegal use.

<strong>It is important that you understand this:</strong> Although this VPN service claims a 'No Logging' policy, the usage of this VPN is not 'guaranteed anonymity.' What you do and how you act on the internet can expose who you are.  This is simply an encrypted tunnel to protect you on your local segment, when you exit the VPN node, you are on the internet. Email or other web services can expose your identity. If you have any concerns, talk to someone at SecKC (your neighbor will do), this is a fun topic!

To put it as clearly as possible:
<ul>
	<li>SecKC is sharing this account to it's members to protect your communications. We are sharing ONE USERNAME and ONE PASSWORD. Do not give it out to any one. If you do, you are a huge jerk and may cause this to go away. It is for SecKC members only.</li>
	<li>SecKC does not have ANY visibility into account usage. We don't know who is using it, or what they are doing on it.  We don't have any way to assert on what type of monitoring AzireVPN has, but regardless it would be tied to the SecKC account, and not an individual.  Additionally, we dont track the SecKC members that asked to access the account.  We give the password away openly at meetings, and do not keep a log of who attends meetings.</li>
	<li>We are utilizing the AzireVPN service [<a href="https://www.azirevpn.net/">LINK</a>] for our membership VPN. They were listed in TorrentFreaks "Which VPN Services Take Your Anonymity Seriously? 2015 Edition" [<a href="https://torrentfreak.com/anonymous-vpn-service-provider-review-2015-150228/2/">LINK]</a> and state that they do not keep any logs. If you have any questions about their policies or capabilities, do your own research. In fact, do your own research before ever using the product.</li>
	<li>SecKC may change the password, and if we do, the new password will be shared at SecKC meetings.</li>
