SecKC is dedicated to supporting the local Kansas City InfoSec community by providing a regular meeting space to share knowledge, collaborate on projects, share tools, and grow as a group.

These learning opportunities programs benefit companies through better educated, trained and engaged employees. At SecKC meetings your employees will be learning a wide range current information security topics, from cutting edge tools and tactics to foundational concepts that can help mature your InfoSec program. Additionally, SecKC meetings are an approved ISC2 Continuing Professional Education (CPE) organization, and can assist in meeting CPE requirements.

Although SecKC membership is free and open to anyone who would like to attend, we would like to ask those organizations that receive benefit through employee participation help support our organization with a yearly membership fee.

Organizations that wish to support SecKC can opt in to a $100/yr (per member) Professional Due for “Corporate Membership”. A Corporate membership provides the exact same benefits as a “free membership”, however these funds will be used to enable the SecKC mission for supporting projects and events in the future.
