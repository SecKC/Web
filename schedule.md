    <td>The Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) v7.0 is on the verge of being released. This new version has a lot of new features, a rewrite for Python3 and more. In this talk we'll be diving down into how to most effectively use SET for offensive capabilities and bypass a number of the preventiative measures out there today. In addition, we'll go into some more advanced discussions on methods you can use on a test to get a little more custom and get around most (if not all) of the prevenative technologies today.</td>
